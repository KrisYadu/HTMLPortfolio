<h1>The Best Movies According to Yadu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Memories (Malayalam)</h3>
<p>
  This is currently my favourite Malayalam movie. I love everything about it
  especially the screenplay and direction along with one of the finest
  background scoring. It's a splendid thriller!
</p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>
  One of the finest sci-fi movies ever. The more you watch the movie, the movie
  unviels itself on you. Christopher Nlan has did a fantastic job making this
  movie!
</p>

<h3>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</h3>
<p>
  Super beautiful film. The narration along the uniqness in the story makes it
  one of a kind movie. The lon-linear story telling in a scene is indeed a
  masterpiece. All in all, stellar cinematic treat.
